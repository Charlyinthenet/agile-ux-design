## Agility: Adaptability 

Adaptability as a driver: more agility/adaptability => more value.

Two common misunderstanding:
* Agility = fast
* Agility = cheap
Fast and cheap are usual - and welcome - side effects, but not guaranteed!

### Adaptive VS incremental
Means that between iteration there’s a replan

### The waterfall model and the rise of Agility
* Agile alternative started around 199x with:

### Characteristics of Agile
* Empirical processes
* Considers the complex systems nature of software projects
* Iterative
* Fast feedback
* Teamwork
* Sustainable pace
* Continuously improved


### Empirical VS defined process

### Agile == continuous improvement
Use the 🇬🇧📃[Deming cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA)
Plan => Do => Check => Act => Plan => ... and repeat


### Cost (or investment?) of change
That’s for sure, there is an inevitable cost of change over time: but how to reduce ?
* Modularity
* Agile architecture
* Clean code
* Automatic tests
* Refactoring

## Agile manifesto
The manifesto is a formal statement of what agile software development is.
* Made of 4 values expressed as “X over Y”
* Made of 12 principles
* Not software centric!

### Agile 4 Values and Tips added
> 
> <cite> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:
> 1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools </cite>

Tips: better a short meeting prepared and facilitated by SM and PO with a visual and co-created board than a series of long emails with Excel attached

> 2. Working software over comprehensive documentation

Tips: a co-design session is better than functional documentation

> 3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Tips: a workshop for the creation of a service blueprint is better than the answer to a tender

> 4. Responding to change over following a plan

Tips: better to do a review that brings to light a disagreement between various business units to understand where you want to go, which direction you have taken and which one you want to take from that moment

> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

### Agile 12 principles

> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

> Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

> Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

> Working software is the primary measure of progress.

> Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

> Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

> Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.

> The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Scrum
Is a “Lightweight Framework” for Project Management that can help teams build complex products, Is abstract and not prescriptive.
First gained widespread popularity in 1995 when presented by Ken Shwaber and Jeff Sutherland.

### Scrum framework - characteristics
* Empiricism 
knowledge made on evidence and experience.
To do an estimate the time isn’t divided into perfect sections, instead it is used predictive approach and add experience to the estimate.
* Characteristics
  * 3 clearly defined roles
  * Self-organising team
  * Timeboxed Iterations of “Potentially Shippable Products”
  * Simple to understand, difficult to master!
* Core elements
  * Deliver working product every sprint
  * Inspect and adapt every day = learn
  * Trust the team

### Scrum pillars (TIA)

* Transparency

All aspect of the process must be visible
La trasparenza richiede che tutti gli aspetti siano definiti da uno standard comune in
modo tale che gli osservatori condividano una comune comprensione di ciò̀ che viene visto.

  * Agreement on:
    * What the work will be
    * How will be completed
    * What done means


* Inspection
The team frequently inspects the work they’re doing and assess whether the’re moving closer to the goa

* Adaptation
When team recognize that work is not getting closer to the goal they adapt their practices and approach to change direction


### Scrum Values 
To establish trust:
* Focus

Because we focus on only a few things at a time, we work well together and produce excellent work. We deliver valuable items Sooner. Time-boxed events facilitate

* Courage

Because we work as a team, we feel supported and have more resources at our disposal. This gives us the courage to undertake greater challenges
Continuous inspection and adaptation of work requires a degree of courage

* Commitment

Because we have great control over our own destiny, we are more committed to success. Scrum requires a commitment to agile principles to be successful

* Openness

As we work together, we express how we're doing, what's in our way, and our concerns so they can be addressed

* Respect

As we work together, sharing successes and failures, we come to respect each other and to help each other become worthy of respect.

### Scrum - the elements

* 3 Roles
  * Team member
  * ScrumMaster
  * Product Owner

* 3+ Artifacts
  * Product Backlog
  * Sprint Backlog
  * Burndown Chart
  * Progress Indicators…

* 5+ Events
  * The Sprint
  * Sprint Planning
  * Daily Standup
  * Sprint Review,
  * Sprint Retrospective (all events are timeboxed!)
  * Activity: Product Backlog Refinement
