# Scrum events

5 main Events:
* [Sprint]
1. Sprint planning
2. Daily scrum (daily Standup)
3. Sprint Review
4. Sprint Retrospective
* Product backlog refinement [Scrum alliance]

## Sprint 
## Sprint goal 

is the high-level goal of each time-boxed sprint written as concisely as possible
The development team then plans how to convert the goal items into a product increment
The sprint backlog is a subset of a product backlog and contains items selected for the sprint, plus additional items for the development team.

### During a Sprint:

No changes can be made that put the Sprint Goal at risk;
Quality-related goals must not degrade and,
The Scope can be clarified and renegotiated between the Product Owner and the Development Team, when there is more information about it.

### Cancel a Sprint
A Sprint can be canceled before the maximum time limit has expired.
Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint, although he can also do so under the influence of stakeholders, the Development Team or the Scrum Master.
A Sprint should be canceled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete.
This could occur if the organization changes direction or if market or technology conditions change.
When a Sprint is canceled, any completed and “Done” Product Backlog items are reviewed. If part of the work is potentially releasable the PO typically accepts it. Any incomplete Product Backlog entries are re-estimated and re-entered into the Product Backlog.

## Sprint planning
### Sprint Plan - A guide

Attendees: Scrum Team, including shared resources

Duration: 2–8 hours, based on the Sprint length

Frequency: Once per Sprint; first day of the Sprint

Inputs for Successful Planning
Ordered (Prioritized) Product Backlog
What was completed in the last Sprint/Product Increment
Past performance of the Development Team (Velocity)
Development Team capacity for the Sprint (who is OoO)

#### Topics for Planning Discussion
Phase 1 - Po & Dev Team
Definition of the Sprint Goal: What is the sprint goal?

Definition of the Sprint Backlog Content: What will be done in this Sprint?
Product Backlog Items (PBIs) to select from the Product Backlog to create a Product Increment. This is solely the decision of the Development Team.
The selected PBIs influences the Scrum Team in defining the Sprint Goal.

Team commitment!

Phase 1 - Dev Team (PO does not need to be present)
Team defines the tasks for each story: How to do the selected work to get it done?
Knowing the Goal, the Development Team decides how to build the functionality
into a “Done” Product Increment.
The Development Team defines the tasks it needs to complete the Product Increment;  tasks are decomposed into small pieces of a day or less.
A guideline : story = value delivered, task technical activity


##### Outcomes of Successful Planning

* Sprint Goal and what will be completed (PBIs)
* Current sprint
* 1 or 2 future sprints
* How the work will be done (Plan)
* Sprint Backlog

##### Possible problems:
Dominant personality → talk with him
Starting phase → facilitate

#### Sprint Plan - Task Breakdown

* Task duration: 4-16 hours
 * Shorter: too much process overhead
 * Longer: difficult to track and estimate

* Use a template
 * Design, Unit tests, Prepare for Review, Doc, ...
* Make it a Team work
* Estimation in hours: needed or not?
* Effective tasks
 * Are the tasks mapping the real work?
* Avoid “mine and yours”
* Focus on what needs to be done, not on who does

## Daily Scrum

A guide:
Attendees: The Scrum Team, including shared resources and any interested parties: however, only Scrum (Team members provide updates), PO optional, but recommended

The Scrum Master: 
- facilitate
- ensure it takes place

Duration: 15 minutes

Frequency: Every day of the Sprint - same time - same place


Objective: Inspect and Adapt to further progress toward the Sprint Goal, transparency with the burndown chart update


Structure:
Each Development Team member will answer each question every day:
What have you done since yesterday (to help meet the Sprint Goal) ?
What are you planning to do today (to help meet the Sprint Goal) ?
Do you have impediments preventing you from accomplish your goal?
Possible further question: Where do I need help ?


After the time-boxed Scrum, Team members can continue detailed discussions to answer
questions, solve problems, refine the design, or adapt the remaining Sprint work.



## Backlog refinement
Can mean 2 things:
The iterative ongoing process used by PO to get work information about product needs and requirements
Scrum meeting after the midpoint in the scrum

### A guide:
Attendees: The Scrum Team, including shared resources and Subject Matter Experts if needed

Duration: 1–4 hours, depending on the Sprint length


### Frequency: 
Once per Sprint, usually after the midpoint of the Sprint (day 5,6 or 7)

### Objective: 
Inspect and Adapt the Product Backlog and PBIs to ensure targeted PBIs are ready for the next Sprint

### Topics covered:
PO presents the ordered backlog and identifies PBIs they’d like in the next +⅔) Sprint
Development Team asks questions and requests additional details if needed
Any PBI that has enough information is sized by the Development Team in the session

### Output:
List of PBIs for clarification and the questions that need to be answered


The Scrum Master ensures the event takes place and is well-facilitated. Scrum Master also ensures the timebox is adhered to.

## Sprint Review
* Notes for sharing the team’s work:
* Validate who is invited to the sprint review
* Develop a stakeholder map with the product owner
* Identify stakeholders and the impact for each
* Identify the features & functionalities important for the stakeholders
* Develop a customized approach/language for each stakeholder

### A guide:
Attendees: The Scrum Team, including shared resources, and Stakeholders

### Duration: 1 hour /sprint-week, depending on Sprint length

### Frequency: Once per Sprint, usually on the last day of the Sprint; it’s the next-to-last event in the Sprint

### Objective: Collaboratively inspect the Product Increment and adapt the Product Backlog

### Structure:
The Sprint Review is meant to be an informal collaboration on the current Product Increment and to collectively update the Product Backlog with information from the Stakeholders that may influence the Backlog contents.


### Topics covered:
* Recap of the Sprint: PO provides an overview of the Sprint Goal and the PBIs that were selected.
* Demonstration of the work done: Development Team demonstrates the Product Increment and answers questions.
* Visibility and closure of an iteration
* Sprint review as feedback
* PO facilitates open discussion with the Stakeholders, capturing feedback and outside information that may help the Scrum Team.
* PO adds appropriate feedback into the Backlog.
* Looking at the following Sprints: PO shares the Product Backlog and the projection of completion based on current progress.

* The Scrum Master ensures the event takes place and is well-facilitated. 
* Scrum Master also ensures the timebox is adhered to.


## Sprint Retrospective 
This is the one agile practice to implement.
This is the most important event to gain a process improvement: what did we learn & what can we improve


### Retrospective - A guide

Attendees: The Scrum Team, including shared resources if they’ve been working on the
Team in the Sprint

Duration: 1–3 hours, depending on Sprint length
Frequency: Once per Sprint, thi is the last event in the Sprint
Objective: Inspect and Adapt the Team’s processes; select items for focused improvement

#### Topics covered:
Inspect how the last Sprint went in regard to people, relationships, collaboration,
processes, and tools.
Question to ask:
What went well during the sprint?
What didn't’ went well during the sprint?
Create an ordered list of major items that went well and those that could be improved.
Create a plan for implementing selected improvements to how the team works.
Use SMART goals!


The Scrum Master ensures the event takes place and is well-facilitated. Scrum Master also ensures the timebox is adhered to. 
As the process owner, the Scrum Master is an active participant in the event.


### Reveal the root causes:
Develop a shares pool of knowledge
To do this accomplish this:
Ensure that everyone on the team is contributing to the conversation

Dunning–Kruger effect → cognitive bias in which people of low ability have illusory superiority and mistakenly assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is. 
Without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their competence or incompetence.

Make sure quiet people talk!


Encourage everyone to discuss:
What went right
What went wrong
Listen to every voice


Identify pattern which deepen your understanding of the problem
(group similarities)


Facilitate exposing insight
Using this questions:
“What have we learned as a result of the pattern we uncovered ?”
“What is the root cause ?”
“ What’s important?”
“How can you see more clarity ?”
Improving Retrospectives
Bring your own observation
Remind that the retrospective is a safe zone
Follow a pattern to share a insight

### Templates:
Starfish diagram → Ogni sezione una categoria 


Question circle 
→ Every team member ask the next person “how do you think we could improve … [our team’s estimate]?”


Futurespective 
→ image to have the retro 1 year later at the end of the project
Then they return at today and ask how to build that success
