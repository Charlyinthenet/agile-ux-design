        * Focus on the team purpose and norms to solve conflict
        * Use facilitation and conflict resolution skills 
        * Storming in which the team does not perform per ecosystem in which management requires a lot of status reports, useless documentation, continuous emergencies, ... The SM tries to intervene to make management understand that agility also requires a change in the way management works ! Regardless of the reason, recovering agile development is usually relatively easy: given the level of collaboration within the team, it is very likely that the information is shared enough to make "recovery" actions much easier, as less dependent on the knowledge of individuals.
    * Tips
        * Keep goals in front of the team
        * Use Teams norms to guide interaction
        * Use measures of success

* Norming (when members take responsibility for their work and team interaction)

    * Norming questions
        * What are current product defects and how can they be prevented?
        * How can the team become more efficient when delivering customers value?
        * What can the team deliver that will delight customers?

* Performing (when the team is autonomous and operates with little guidance)
*   Member demonstrate loyalty. 
*   Conflicts are resolved quickly
