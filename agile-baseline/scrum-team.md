# The Scrum Team

3 main roles:
* Product owner
* Scrum Master
* Development team members

## Development team
* The goal is to have 3 to 9 people to contain the need for coordination and complexity as much as possible.
* Focus: produce a potentially shippable product increment
* Characteristics:
	* Self organized and operates with minimal input from external sources => self managing.
	* Task assignment
		* 	The development team owns the entire sprint backlog (selected product backlog items, plus developments tasks) = auto organizzati sul come trasformare un elemento del Product Backlog in un incremento di funzionalità potenzialmente rilasciabile
* Accountable together
* Responsible together for the best technical solutions
	* Multidisciplinary => Cross functional
	* End2 End teams from the user to the product
* 100% committed

No hierarchy or sub-team.
There are no managers or team leads - it is a flat hierarchy
Doesn’t acknowledge roles/titles (they’re all team members) = non ci sono altri titoli, per un membro del Development Team, al di fuori di Developer…
the members of the Development Team may have specific skills and areas of focus, but the responsibility belongs to the entire Development Team as a whole
Event better: Feature Teams!

### Feature Teams VS Component teams
Feature teams shift the coordination challenge between teams away from upfront requirements, design, and inter-team project management and toward coordination at the code level. [...] with modern agile practices and tools, coordinating at the code level is relatively easy. - Larman, Vodde - “Scaling Lean and Agile Development”, pag. 174

#### Communication
Component team: problem => communication in the team

Communication in the feature team can be solved with an informal group (a community of practice) made up of team representatives (everyone can participate but it is not mandatory) in which decisions are made - rather than carrying out work / tasks - and the results of these decisions flow into the backlog.


#### Shared resources

How to maximize:
* Early inclusion
* Big picture perspective
* Backlog understanding
* Timing estimation

#### Norms
Helps members create shared behaviors to enhance performance.
* Interaction norms:
	* All ideas are equal
	* Ask help suddenly
	* Keep commitments
	* Hold team accountable

* Communications norms
	* Respect
	* gratitude

* Meeting interaction norms
	* Device usage
	* Start / end on time
Preferred hours

* Decision making norms
	* Consensus
	* Majority

* Conflict resolution norms
	* Process
	* Expectation
	* Escalation

#### Tools and location
* Co-location is the best but  give team member the option (collaborative space VS individual space)
* Digital file sharing
* Chat and video conf tools


## Product Owner
* He is a single person (not a committee)
* Responsible for ROI of the Product
* Takes product decision => Decide about the scope and manage the product backlog prioritization
	* (What is the right thing to do and what time is right)
* Clarify requirements
* Clearly express PBIs (is  experienced to answer dev team questions)
* Order PBIs efficiently (ordina gli elementi del Product Backlog per raggiungere gli obbiettivi)
* Have sufficient influence in the organization to negotiate PBIs with peers and leader
* Ensure backlog is accessible
* Provide status report and forecast
* Have interpersonal skills to ensure support
* Terminate a Sprint
* Maximize value of dev team effort
* Facilitates interaction (Team and Client, Management, Marketing, other stakeholder)

### Product Owner as a Product Development Facilitator

The product Owner - like the backlog - of which he is the curator - is at the center.

In fact, stakeholders have a vague idea of the product (their visibility follows). Only when this idea is well defined can the Development team create the product.
In order to do this, communication - clarification - is necessary, so that the Development team can write the Sprint Backlog.

It is the PO that:
* Create the product strategy
* Decide what should be in the backlog
* Decide on prioritization

#### The “contract game”
It is from the mixture of the Business authority on Product Management and the responsibility of Development for everything related to R&D Management that the Contract Game for which the PO is responsible opens up.
From Larman-Vodde, “Practices for Scaling Lean & Agile Development”

### Product Owner - practical tips
#### Set the product vision
Design the box => https://gamestorming.com/design-the-box/

##### Turn the vision into a roadmap
4 hours for 4 day. Product roadmap session with Scrum master team and stakeholders
Choose story map (grouped in themes) and give priority note that this is an estimate that change at every session of planning.

##### Writing stories
Beginning: broad idea (epic) => then are decomposed in stories when more details appear.
With INVEST criteria.


To break down the epic 2 ways:
	⁃	CRUD functionalities
	⁃	steps 


##### Backlog refinement
Usually done in 2 meetings:
Pre-planning: with the all team so they eventually listen gap in a.cc
Backlog grooming: SM, PO, SME and technical expert they have to write stories and rewrite. Then the backlog is updated and the planning refined

##### Detailed release planning
1-2 hours  - Not the all project but 3 to 6 months
2 types:
schedule release plan: you have a due date and decide what to delivery by that time (by point and velocity)
functionality: determine what value to release in a time frame


##### Manage sprint failure
If that the stakeholder doesn’t agree with story or acceptance criteria. 
Abnormal termination of a sprint: the sprint is no valid (is the p.o. that has to decide)
