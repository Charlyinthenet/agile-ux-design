## Agility: Adaptability 
### Historic note 
Agile is the word chosen instead of Adaptable because at the time it was used by another company. The speed of the production cycle is a key factor. The faster it is - the more tests - the better the product… Amazon is said to go into production every 8 seconds.

### Agility: Adaptability
Adaptability as a driver: more agility/adaptability => more value
Two common misunderstanding:
Agility = fast
Agility = cheap
Fast and cheap are usual - and welcome - side effects, but not guaranteed!

### Adaptive VS incremental
Means that between iteration there’s a replan

### The waterfall model and the rise of Agility
Agile alternative started around 199x with:

### Characteristics of Agile
Empirical processes
Considers the complex systems nature of software projects
Iterative
Fast feedback
Teamwork
Sustainable pace
Continuously improved


### Empirical VS defined process

[...] ​​This new emphasis on speed and flexibility calls for a different approach for managing new product development.

### Agile == continuous improvement
The deDeming cycle
Plan => Do => Check => Act => Plan =>...

### What is Agile ?


### Cost (or investment?) of change
That’s for sure, there is an inevitable cost of change over time: but how to reduce ?
Modularity
Agile architecture
Clean code
Automatic tests
Refactoring

## Agile manifesto
The manifesto is a formal statement of what agile software development is.
Made of 4 values expressed as “X over Y”
Made of 12 principles
Not software centric!

### Agile 4 Values and Tips added
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
Tips: better a short meeting prepared and facilitated by SM and PO with a visual and co-created board than a series of long emails with Excel attached
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Tips: a co-design session is better than functional documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Tips: a workshop for the creation of a service blueprint is better than the answer to a tender
Responding to change over following a plan
Tips: better to do a review that brings to light a disagreement between various business units to understand where you want to go, which direction you have taken and which one you want to take from that moment
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

### Agile 12 principles
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.



## Scrum
A “Lightweight Framework” for Project Management that can help teams build complex products, Is abstract and not prescriptive.
First gained widespread popularity in 1995 when presented by Ken Shwaber and Jeff Sutherland. Available at the following link: [https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf] (https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf) and for italian speaker [https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2020/2020-Scrum-Guide-Italian.pdf](https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2020/2020-Scrum-Guide-Italian.pdf)

1.3.1 Scrum framework - characteristics
Empiricism 
knowledge made on evidence and experience.
To do an estimate the time isn’t divided into perfect sections, instead it is used predictive approach and add experience to the estimate.
Characteristics
3 clearly defined roles
Self-organising team
Timeboxed Iterations of “Potentially Shippable Products”
Simple to understand, difficult to master!
Core elements
Deliver working product every sprint
Inspect and adapt every day = learn
Trust the team
### Scrum pillars (TIA)

Transparency


All aspect of the process must be visible
La trasparenza richiede che tutti gli aspetti siano definiti da uno standard comune in
modo tale che gli osservatori condividano una comune comprensione di ciò̀ che viene visto.


Agreement on:
What the work will be
How will be completed
What done means



Inspection


The team frequently inspects the work they’re doing and assess whether the’re moving closer to the goa



Adaptation
When team recognize that work is not getting closer to the goal they adapt their practices and approach to change direction


### Scrum Values 
To establish trust:
Focus
Because we focus on only a few things at a time, we work well together and produce excellent work. We deliver valuable items Sooner. Time-boxed events facilitate
Courage
Because we work as a team, we feel supported and have more resources at our disposal. This gives us the courage to undertake greater challenges
Continuous inspection and adaptation of work requires a degree of courage
Commitment
Because we have great control over our own destiny, we are more committed to success. Scrum requires a commitment to agile principles to be successful
Openness
As we work together, we express how we're doing, what's in our way, and our concerns so they can be addressed
Respect
As we work together, sharing successes and failures, we come to respect each other and to help each other become worthy of respect.
