## Agility: Adaptability 
### Historic note 
Agile is the word chosen instead of Adaptable because at the time it was used by another company. The speed of the production cycle is a key factor. The faster it is - the more tests - the better the product‚Ä¶ Amazon is said to go into production every 8 seconds.

### Agility: Adaptability
Adaptability as a driver: more agility/adaptability => more value
Two common misunderstanding:
Agility = fast
Agility = cheap
Fast and cheap are usual - and welcome - side effects, but not guaranteed!

### Adaptive VS incremental
Means that between iteration there‚Äôs a replan

### The waterfall model and the rise of Agility
Agile alternative started around 199x with:

### Characteristics of Agile
Empirical processes
Considers the complex systems nature of software projects
Iterative
Fast feedback
Teamwork
Sustainable pace
Continuously improved


### Empirical VS defined process

[...] a holistic or ‚Äúrugby‚Äù approach‚Äîwhere a team tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth‚Äîmay better serve today‚Äôs competitive requirements. [...] ‚Äã‚ÄãThis new emphasis on speed and flexibility calls for a different approach for managing new product development. [...] a holistic or ‚Äúrugby‚Äù approach‚Äîwhere a team tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth‚Äîmay better serve today‚Äôs competitive requirements.
[Takeuchi, Nonaka, ‚ÄúThe New New Product Development Game‚Äù] https://hbr.org/1986/01/the-new-new-product-development-game

### Agile == continuous improvement
The deDeming cycle
Plan => Do => Check => Act => Plan =>...

### What is Agile ?


### Cost (or investment?) of change
That‚Äôs for sure, there is an inevitable cost of change over time: but how to reduce ?
Modularity
Agile architecture
Clean code
Automatic tests
Refactoring

## Agile manifesto
The manifesto is a formal statement of what agile software development is.
Made of 4 values expressed as ‚ÄúX over Y‚Äù
Made of 12 principles
Not software centric!

### Agile 4 Values and Tips added
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
Tips: better a short meeting prepared and facilitated by SM and PO with a visual and co-created board than a series of long emails with Excel attached
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Tips: a co-design session is better than functional documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Tips: a workshop for the creation of a service blueprint is better than the answer to a tender
Responding to change over following a plan
Tips: better to do a review that brings to light a disagreement between various business units to understand where you want to go, which direction you have taken and which one you want to take from that moment
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
Available at the following link: [http://agilemanifesto.org/] (http://agilemanifesto.org/)

### Agile 12 principles
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer‚Äôs competitive advantage.
Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
Simplicity‚Äìthe art of maximizing the amount of work not done‚Äìis essential.
The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.



## Scrum
A ‚ÄúLightweight Framework‚Äù for Project Management that can help teams build complex products, Is abstract and not prescriptive.
First gained widespread popularity in 1995 when presented by Ken Shwaber and Jeff Sutherland. Available at the following link: [https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf] (https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf) and for italian speaker [https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2020/2020-Scrum-Guide-Italian.pdf](https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2020/2020-Scrum-Guide-Italian.pdf)

1.3.1 Scrum framework - characteristics
Empiricism 
knowledge made on evidence and experience.
To do an estimate the time isn‚Äôt divided into perfect sections, instead it is used predictive approach and add experience to the estimate.
Characteristics
3 clearly defined roles
Self-organising team
Timeboxed Iterations of ‚ÄúPotentially Shippable Products‚Äù
Simple to understand, difficult to master!
Core elements
Deliver working product every sprint
Inspect and adapt every day = learn
Trust the team
### Scrum pillars (TIA)

Transparency


All aspect of the process must be visible
La trasparenza richiede che tutti gli aspetti siano definiti da uno standard comune in
modo tale che gli osservatori condividano una comune comprensione di ci√≤ÃÄ che viene visto.


Agreement on:
What the work will be
How will be completed
What done means



Inspection


The team frequently inspects the work they‚Äôre doing and assess whether the‚Äôre moving closer to the goa



Adaptation
When team recognize that work is not getting closer to the goal they adapt their practices and approach to change direction


### Scrum Values 
To establish trust:
Focus
Because we focus on only a few things at a time, we work well together and produce excellent work. We deliver valuable items Sooner. Time-boxed events facilitate
Courage
Because we work as a team, we feel supported and have more resources at our disposal. This gives us the courage to undertake greater challenges
Continuous inspection and adaptation of work requires a degree of courage
Commitment
Because we have great control over our own destiny, we are more committed to success. Scrum requires a commitment to agile principles to be successful
Openness
As we work together, we express how we're doing, what's in our way, and our concerns so they can be addressed
Respect
As we work together, sharing successes and failures, we come to respect each other and to help each other become worthy of respect.

# The Scrum Team
3 main roles:
Product owner
Scrum Master
Development team members

## Development team
The goal is to have 3 to 9 people to contain the need for coordination and complexity as much as possible.
Focus: produce a potentially shippable product increment
Characteristics:
Self organized and operates with minimal input from external sources => self managing.
Task assignment
The development team owns the entire sprint backlog (selected product backlog items, plus developments tasks) = auto organizzati sul come trasformare un elemento del Product Backlog in un incremento di funzionalit√† potenzialmente rilasciabile
Accountable together
Responsible together for the best technical solutions
Multidisciplinary => Cross functional
Con al suo interno tutte le abilit√† necessarie per creare un incremento di prodotto
End2 End teams from the user to the product
100% committed

No hierarchy or sub-team.
There are no managers or team leads - it is a flat hierarchy
Doesn‚Äôt acknowledge roles/titles (they‚Äôre all team members) = non ci sono altri titoli, per un membro del Development Team, al di fuori di Developer‚Ä¶
the members of the Development Team may have specific skills and areas of focus, but the responsibility belongs to the entire Development Team as a whole
Event better: Feature Teams!

### Feature Teams VS Component teams
Feature teams shift the coordination challenge between teams away from upfront requirements, design, and inter-team project management and toward coordination at the code level. [...] with modern agile practices and tools, coordinating at the code level is relatively easy. - Larman, Vodde - ‚ÄúScaling Lean and Agile Development‚Äù, pag. 174

#### Comunicazione
Component team: problem => communication in the team

In Alfie Kohn's book ‚ÄúPunished by reward‚Äù management by objectives (MBO) doesn't work - except in the short term.
Communication in the feature team can be solved with an informal group (a community of practice) made up of team representatives (everyone can participate but it is not mandatory) in which decisions are made - rather than carrying out work / tasks - and the results of these decisions flow into the backlog.
Open discussion means that a UX for example can participate in the architecture community.
It is the Scrum Master that stimulates the creation of communities and in case of discussion stimulates transparency by pushing to demonstrate, for example, pros and cons to submit them to the community.
#### Shared resources
How to maximize:
Early inclusion
Big picture perspective
Backlog understanding
Timing estimation
#### Norms
Helps members create shared behaviors to enhance performance.
Interaction norms:
All ideas are equal
Ask help suddenly
Keep commitments
Hold team accountable

Communications norms
Respect
gratitude

Meeting interaction norms
Device usage
Start / end on time
Preferred hours

Decision making norms
Consensus
Majority

Conflict resolution norms
Process
Expectation
Escalation

#### Tools and location
Co-location is the best but 
give team member the option (collaborative space VS individual space)
Digital file sharing
Chat and video conf tools


## Product Owner
He is a single person (not a committee)
Responsible for ROI of the Product
Takes product decision => Decide about the scope and manage the product backlog prioritization
(What is the right thing to do and what time is right), ‚Äã‚Äãsi assicura che il Development Team capisca gli elementi del Product Backlog al livello necessario
Clarify requirements
Clearly express PBIs (is  experienced to answer dev team questions)
Order PBIs efficiently (ordina gli elementi del Product Backlog per raggiungere gli obbiettivi)
Have sufficient influence in the organization to negotiate PBIs with peers and leader
Ensure backlog is accessible
Provide status report and forecast
Have interpersonal skills to ensure support
Terminate a Sprint
Maximize value of dev team effort
Facilitates interaction (Team and Client, Management, Marketing, other stakeholder)
lavora con lo Scrum Team e gli Stakeholders per migliorare costantemente il Product Backlog

### Product Owner as a Product Development Facilitator

The product Owner - like the backlog - of which he is the curator - is at the center.

In fact, stakeholders have a vague idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe product (their visibility follows). Only when this idea is well defined can the Development team create the product.
In order to do this, communication - clarification - is necessary, so that the Development team can write the Sprint Backlog.
It is the PO that:
Create the product strategy
Decide what should be in the backlog
Decide on prioritization

#### The ‚Äúcontract game‚Äù
It is from the mixture of the Business authority on Product Management and the responsibility of Development for everything related to R&D Management that the Contract Game for which the PO is responsible opens up.
From Larman-Vodde, ‚ÄúPractices for Scaling Lean & Agile Development‚Äù

### Product Owner - practical tips
#### Set the product vision
Design the box => https://gamestorming.com/design-the-box/

##### Turn the vision into a roadmap
4 hours for 4 day. Product roadmap session with Scrum master team and stakeholders
Choose story map (grouped in themes) and give priority note that this is an estimate that change at every session of planning.

##### Writing stories
Beginning: broad idea (epic) => then are decomposed in stories when more details appear.
With INVEST criteria.


To break down the epic 2 ways:
	‚ÅÉ	CRUD functionalities
	‚ÅÉ	steps 


##### Backlog grooming
Usually done in 2 meetings:
Pre-planning: with the all team so they eventually listen gap in a.cc
Backlog grooming: SM, PO, SME and technical expert they have to write stories and rewrite. Then the backlog is updated and the planning refined

##### Detailed release planning
1-2 hours  - Not the all project but 3 to 6 months
2 types:
schedule release plan: you have a due date and decide what to delivery by that time (by point and velocity)
functionality: determine what value to release in a time frame


##### Manage sprint failure
If that the stakeholder doesn‚Äôt agree with story or acceptance criteria. 
Abnormal termination of a sprint: the sprint is no valid (is the p.o. that has to decide)





## Scrum master 
The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that Scrum is understood: making sure the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum's values, practices and rules.
Focus attention on circumstances and main goals
Working with the team (everything - in order to balance the attention between the Dev team and the PO) trying to earn their trust.
The SM must be a medium not the controller. Hold a position of "multi-directed partiality" (https://behavenet.com/multidirectional-partiality - MS should act as the therapist)
SM is sometimes referred to as the servant leader. Key traits of a servant Leader:
Persuasion
Empathy
Listening & communicating
Tips: mirror what you heard
Negotiation

How the SM supports
Interaction team-team
Support the application of the scrum framework ‚Üí Stay in the process 
Ensures goals, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone on the Scrum Team, 
Through Scrum practice (sometimes SM referred as a Team guardian)

Ask:
‚ÄúDoes this practice still apply to us?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a radical idea?‚Äù
Promote share of idea and give equal weight, asking for example:

2.3.1 SMr at all stages
Forming (time when a team gets to know each other)
Forming tips
Anticipate the team‚Äôs questions
Repeat the purpose and vision


Team questions
Who are the other team members?
What is the work?
How should the work been tackled?
What are the process in getting work done?


Facilitate tips
Hold individual meeting
Facilitate group conversation



Storming (when disagreements arise on the team)
Storming tips
Focus on the team purpose and norms per risolvere i conflitti
Use facilitation and conflict resolution skills 
Storming in which the team does not perform per ecosystem in which management requires a lot of status reports, useless documentation, continuous emergencies, ... The SM tries to intervene to make management understand that agility also requires a change in the way management works ! Regardless of the reason, recovering agile development is usually relatively easy: given the level of collaboration within the team, it is very likely that the information is shared enough to make "recovery" actions much easier, as less dependent on the knowledge of individuals.
Tips
Keep goals in front of the team
Use Teams norms to guide interaction
Use measures of success


Norming (when members take responsibility for their work and team interaction)
Make sure the team‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt avoid controversy at this stage
Norming questions
What are current product defects and how can they be prevented?
How can the team become more efficient when delivering customers value?
What can the team deliver that will delight customers?


Performing (when the team is autonomous and operates with little guidance)
Member demonstrate loyalty. Conflicts are resolved quickly





3 Scrum events
5 main Events:
[Sprint]
1.Sprint planning
2. Daily scrum (daily Standup)
3. Sprint Review
4. Sprint Retrospective
(+) Product backlog refinement [Scrum alliance]

## Sprint 
##Sprint goal 
is the high-level goal of each time-boxed sprint written as concisely as possible
The development team then plans how to convert the goal items into a product increment
The sprint backlog is a subset of a product backlog and contains items selected for the sprint, plus additional items for the development team.
During a Sprint:
No changes can be made that put the Sprint Goal at risk;
Quality-related goals must not degrade and,
The Scope can be clarified and renegotiated between the Product Owner and the Development Team, when there is more information about it.

### Cancel a Sprint
A Sprint can be canceled before the maximum time limit has expired.
Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint, although he can also do so under the influence of stakeholders, the Development Team or the Scrum Master.
A Sprint should be canceled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete.
This could occur if the organization changes direction or if market or technology conditions change.
When a Sprint is canceled, any completed and ‚ÄúDone‚Äù Product Backlog items are reviewed. If part of the work is potentially releasable the PO typically accepts it. Any incomplete Product Backlog entries are re-estimated and re-entered into the Product Backlog.

## Sprint planning
### Sprint Plan - A guide
Attendees: Scrum Team, including shared resources


Duration: 2‚Äì8 hours, based on the Sprint length


Frequency: Once per Sprint; first day of the Sprint

Inputs for Successful Planning
Ordered (Prioritized) Product Backlog
What was completed in the last Sprint/Product Increment
Past performance of the Development Team (Velocity)
Development Team capacity for the Sprint (who is OoO)

Topics for Planning Discussion
Phase 1 - Po & Dev Team
Definition of the Sprint Goal: What is the sprint goal?
Lo Sprint Goal √® l‚Äôobiettivo selezionato per lo Sprint che pu√≤ essere raggiunto attraverso l'implementazione del Product Backlog.


Definition of the Sprint Backlog Content: What will be done in this Sprint?
Product Backlog Items (PBIs) to select from the Product Backlog to create a Product Increment. This is solely the decision of the Development Team.
The selected PBIs influences the Scrum Team in defining the Sprint Goal.

Team commitment!

Phase 1 - Dev Team (PO does not need to be present)
Team defines the tasks for each story: How to do the selected work to get it done?
Knowing the Goal, the Development Team decides how to build the functionality
into a ‚ÄúDone‚Äù Product Increment.
The Development Team defines the tasks it needs to complete the Product Increment;  tasks are decomposed into small pieces of a day or less.
A guideline : story = value delivered, task technical activity


Outcomes of Successful Planning
Sprint Goal and what will be completed (PBIs)
Current sprint
1 or 2 future sprints
How the work will be done (Plan)
Sprint Backlog

 Possible problems:
Dominant personality ‚Üí talk with him
Starting phase ‚Üí facilitate

#### Sprint Plan - Task Breakdown

Task duration: 4-16 hours
Shorter: too much process overhead
Longer: difficult to track and estimate
Use a template
Design, Unit tests, Prepare for Review, Doc, ...
Make it a Team work
Estimation in hours: needed or not?
Effective tasks
Are the tasks mapping the real work?
Avoid ‚Äúmine and yours‚Äù
Focus on what needs to be done, not on who does

## Daily Scrum
A guide:
Attendees: The Scrum Team, including shared resources and any interested parties: however, only Scrum (Team members provide updates), PO optional, but recommended

The Scrum Master: 
- facilitate
- ensure it takes place

Duration: 15 minutes


Frequency: Every day of the Sprint - same time - same place


Objective: Inspect and Adapt to further progress toward the Sprint Goal, transparency with the burndown chart update


Structure:
Each Development Team member will answer each question every day:
What have you done since yesterday (to help meet the Sprint Goal) ?
What are you planning to do today (to help meet the Sprint Goal) ?
Do you have impediments preventing you from accomplish your goal?
Possible further question: Where do I need help ?


After the time-boxed Scrum, Team members can continue detailed discussions to answer
questions, solve problems, refine the design, or adapt the remaining Sprint work.



## Backlog refinement
Can mean 2 things:
The iterative ongoing process used by PO to get work information about product needs and requirements
Scrum meeting after the midpoint in the scrum

A guide:
Attendees: The Scrum Team, including shared resources and Subject Matter Experts if needed

Duration: 1‚Äì4 hours, depending on the Sprint length


Frequency: Once per Sprint, usually after the midpoint of the Sprint (day 5,6 or 7)


Objective: Inspect and Adapt the Product Backlog and PBIs to ensure targeted PBIs are ready for the next Sprint

Topics covered:
PO presents the ordered backlog and identifies PBIs they‚Äôd like in the next +‚Öî) Sprint
Development Team asks questions and requests additional details if needed
Any PBI that has enough information is sized by the Development Team in the session

Output:
List of PBIs for clarification and the questions that need to be answered


The Scrum Master ensures the event takes place and is well-facilitated. Scrum Master also ensures the timebox is adhered to.

3.5 Sprint Review
Notes for sharing the team‚Äôs work:
Validate who is invited to the sprint review
Develop a stakeholder map with the product owner
Identify stakeholders and the impact for each
Identify the features & functionalities important for the stakeholders
Develop a customized approach/language for each stakeholder

A guide:
Attendees: The Scrum Team, including shared resources, and Stakeholders


Duration: 1 hour /sprint-week, depending on Sprint length


Frequency: Once per Sprint, usually on the last day of the Sprint; it‚Äôs the next-to-last event in the Sprint


Objective: Collaboratively inspect the Product Increment and adapt the Product Backlog


Structure:
The Sprint Review is meant to be an informal collaboration on the current Product Increment and to collectively update the Product Backlog with information from the Stakeholders that may influence the Backlog contents.


Topics covered:
Recap of the Sprint: PO provides an overview of the Sprint Goal and the PBIs that were selected.
Demonstration of the work done: Development Team demonstrates the Product Increment and answers questions.
Visibility and closure of an iteration
Sprint review as feedback
PO facilitates open discussion with the Stakeholders, capturing feedback and outside information that may help the Scrum Team.
PO adds appropriate feedback into the Backlog.
 Looking at the following Sprints:
PO shares the Product Backlog and the projection of completion based on current progress.


The Scrum Master ensures the event takes place and is well-facilitated. 
Scrum Master also ensures the timebox is adhered to.


## Sprint Retrospective 
This is the one agile practice to implement.
This is the most important event to gain a process improvement: what did we learn & what can we improve


### Retrospective - A guide

Attendees: The Scrum Team, including shared resources if they‚Äôve been working on the
Team in the Sprint


Duration: 1‚Äì3 hours, depending on Sprint length
Frequency: Once per Sprint, thi is the last event in the Sprint
Objective: Inspect and Adapt the Team‚Äôs processes; select items for focused improvement


Topics covered:
Inspect how the last Sprint went in regard to people, relationships, collaboration,
processes, and tools.
Question to ask:
What went well during the sprint?
What didn't‚Äô went well during the sprint?
Create an ordered list of major items that went well and those that could be improved.
Create a plan for implementing selected improvements to how the team works.
Use SMART goals!


The Scrum Master ensures the event takes place and is well-facilitated. Scrum Master also ensures the timebox is adhered to. 
As the process owner, the Scrum Master is an active participant in the event.


### Reveal the root causes:
Develop a shares pool of knowledge
To do this accomplish this:
Ensure that everyone on the team is contributing to the conversation

Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect ‚Üí cognitive bias in which people of low ability have illusory superiority and mistakenly assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is. 
Without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their competence or incompetence.

Make sure quiet people talk!


Encourage everyone to discuss:
What went right
What went wrong
Listen to every voice


Identify pattern which deepen your understanding of the problem
(group similarities)


Facilitate exposing insight
Using this questions:
‚ÄúWhat have we learned as a result of the pattern we uncovered ?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat is the root cause ?‚Äù
‚Äú What‚Äôs important?‚Äù
‚ÄúHow can you see more clarity ?‚Äù
Improving Retrospectives
Bring your own observation
Remind that the retrospective is a safe zone
Follow a pattern to share a insight

# Scrum Artifacts
3 main Artifacts:
Product Backlog
Sprint Backlog
Product Increment
 
## Product backlog
An ordered list of all the works items that might be done for the product.
It‚Äôs the currently best view on the product
Product Backlog Items (PBI) can be:
Functionality description
Requirements
Epics (big Stories)
Development pre-requisites
‚ÄúSpikes‚Äù
Gain technical understanding
Known bugs
Other work items
AND also User Stories(but not exclusively!)
...
But there‚Äôs No need to clarify it all upfront!

It is dynamic and constantly changing to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive and useful. As long as a product exists, its Product Backlog also exists.

Only the PO manage the product backlog (everyone can add PBIs but only PO decides on their value).



### Product backlog item PBIs characteristic:
Every:
Feature
Functionality 
Requirement
Defect
Enhancement
... needed for the product to be robust and valuable.
Its elements have the following attributes: description, order, estimate and value.

Tips:
The Product Backlog, however, could be considered as a "database" with elements
containing the following data:
- Item title
- Description
- Estimate (story point, person days, ...)
- Tentatively schedulable in Sprint
- Dependencies to / from other backlog items [the less dependencies we have, the better!]
This list is, of course, sorted, so each element also has a sequence number.
The Sprint Backlog has a similar format:
- Item title
- Description
- Estimate (story point, person days, ...)
- Dependencies to / from other backlog items [the less dependencies we have, the better!]
In a regulated environment (medical equipment, software involving payments, ...) the backlog often contains elements necessary for tracking how the Item is
implemented: what changes are made, where, ...: in this case the Product Backlog is "crossed" with the version control systems in order to clarify how each
Item.


## Sprint backlog
Subset of the product backlog that lists team selected PBIs
Contains items selected from the sprint, plus task specific to the development team
The development team updates the sprint backlog throughout the sprint

### Backlog ordering
Maintaining the backlog, the steps:
Backlog refinement
Ongoing
PO and delegates refine requirement for product
Backlog refinement event

## Product increment
Total functionality of all the PBIs delivered and accepted in a sprint
Increment requirements:
Team‚Äôs definition of Done
PO‚Äôs acceptance criteria
Value envisioned in Sprint Goal
Documentation

## Other ‚Äúnon-conventional‚Äù artifacts
### User Stories
The User speaks her own business language and has little to no understanding of the technology behind the product she uses. We call this language ‚ÄúBusinessish‚Äù. The Developers instead speak a technical language, very specialised and well-suited for describing the details of the system being developed. Let‚Äôs call this ‚ÄúGeekish‚Äù.

A metaphor 
When you go to the doctor - do you have to study medicine prior to your visit? No! So how does the interaction work? The patient goes to the doctor and explains the problem in her own language, i.e. her ‚ÄúBusinessish‚Äù. So between doctor and patient...
- The interaction happens in Businessish, i.e. the doctor needs to learn and understand Businessish
- The doctor needs technical notes in Geekish to be able to provide a therapy
- The diagnosis is just a token representing the discussion, but it cannot replace the discussion

#### User Stories ‚Äú3Cs‚Äù
Card ‚Üí ‚ÄúUser stories are written on cards. The card does not contain all the information that makes up the requirement. Instead, the card has just enough text to identify the requirement, and to remind everyone what the story is.‚Äù
Conversation ‚Üí ‚ÄúThe requirement itself is communicated from customer to programmers through conversation: an exchange of thoughts, opinions, and feelings. [...] The conversation is largely verbal, but can be supplemented with documents.‚Äù
Confirmation ‚Üí ‚ÄúNo matter how much discussion or how much documentation we produce, we can‚Äôt be as certain as we need to be about what is to be done. The third C in the user story‚Äôs key aspects adds confirmation that we sorely need. This component is the acceptance test.‚Äù



#### User Story Formats
A way to describe a thing we want to build with the best known - ‚ÄúConnextra template‚Äù::
As a ‚Ä¶
I want to
So that
Helps discovers different user type‚Ä¶ but there are some drawbacks:
Many teams use these templates with their brains switched off: they simply use the template mechanically, but without reasoning on what is behind a story. The results can be bad: 
‚ÄúUser Stories‚Äù that are not related to any User of the system 
- ‚ÄúUser Stories‚Äù that do not describe actual functionality (e.g. refactoring) 
- ‚ÄúUser Stories‚Äù that are not a good modelling of the system 
- Focus on the form of the story, rather than on the content
The template generates quite some text that needs to be read over and over. This has the following consequences: 
- Everybody spends a lot of time reading 
- The concept behind the story is not immediately clear 
- Everybody loses the ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù of the product
- It conveys the impression that the text in the template could be made so ‚Äúperfect‚Äù that we do not need anything else
- The template is used as a feed-forward specification
- There is no communication between Developers and Users anymore
The solution is actually very simple: instead of the template, the visible part of the User Story should be a simple 3-5 words description of what the story is about 

##### Acceptance criteria: Set of conditions that defines the criteria that must be met:

### Epics and Themes
Epic: 
a group of features and functionalities.
Seldom used for a business workflow or process
A piece of work that takes more than one sprint to be built


Themes: group of user stories

### Agile estimates
How hard is to build ‚Ä¶? 
Estimates can be defined as:
Abstract units and relative sizing
Translation to calendar days based on actual data


Abstract Units - Relative estimation for Story Points (SP):
Fibonacci scale
Ideal days
T-shirt size
‚Ä¶

#### The value of estimating
For the Team 
Opportunity for analyses 
For the Product Owner 
Understand where the project might end 
Decide on priorities

Tips: There are no measures that * truly * measure the productivity of an agile team. Story points are a subjective measure and, under pressure from management, lead to an effect known as ‚Äústory point inflation‚Äù and other organizational dysfunctions.

Remember: Estimates are not Exactimates!

#### Unbiased estimations
But‚Ä¶ Estimations are subject to bias and groupthinking.
Think about a Planning poker benefits (independent, conversation and consensus)

#####Planning Poker is a way to limit bias 
Developers estimate silently 
All play their ‚Äúcard‚Äù at the same time 
If they are the same, that‚Äôs the estimate 
If not, discuss highest and lowest, go back to 1.
Planning poker - more information http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker and http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/planning-poker 

#####Triangulation
When estimating by Triangulation, a team compares the user story they want to estimate with some previously estimated stories. They then decide if the user story is about the same size, smaller or bigger than the other estimated stories. 
Using Triangulation also has other benefits. Without a good reference system in place, teams sometimes start seeing almost everything as a one, two or three story points. Triangulation may also help the team during planning poker sessions. After each team member has revealed their personal estimate, the team is able to ground their collective estimate by comparing the story with similar work they executed in the past. If there are big discrepancies between the estimates, the team can review past user stories with the same number of story points and see which fits best. Triangulation is a very useful tool that should be in every team's utility belt!

#### Motivation and estimation
Theory X and Theory Y
Created by Douglas McGregor‚Äôs work was rooted in motivation theory alongside the works of Abraham Maslow, who created the hierarchy of needs. The two theories proposed by McGregor describe contrasting models of workforce motivation applied by managers. Theory X explains the importance of heightened supervision, external rewards, and penalties, while Theory Y highlights the motivating role of job satisfaction and encourages workers to approach tasks without direct supervision. 
Management use of Theory X and Theory Y can affect employee motivation and productivity in different ways


It‚Äôs better to have a little pressure to light the fuse ‚Ä¶ Tom Demarco ,Timothy Lister in ‚ÄúPeopleware: Productive Projects and Teams‚Äù

Estimations are not what you want! 
Pressure on team => Change in the estimates 
Less pressure on Team => More Precision 
Time pressure => Low quality 
Estimate <> Commitment! 
‚ÄúPeople under pressure don‚Äôt think faster‚Äù Tom DeMarco in ‚ÄúPeopleware‚Äù

#### Velocity
how many points are accomplished in a sprint?

#### Accuracy VS Precision
Accuracy is closeness of the measurements to a specific value, while precision is the closeness of the measurements to each other.

#### Roadmapping
a classical planning is inaccurate. 
But a roadmap is useful to:
Prioritize
Use timing (near term, mid term and long term)

### Agile prioritization
3 methods:
Assumption testing (remove risk assumption)
Biggest assumption (1-10) + Important score (1-10) = Rank


The BUC method
Business benefit (1-10) + User benefit (1-10) + Cost  (1-10) = Final Score


MOSCOW method
Must
Could
Should
Would

### Definition of done (DoD)
The definition of done is a checklist that must be completed to allow a feature to be considered completed / done.
What does it mean ‚Äústory done‚Äù?
How ‚Äúpotentially shippable‚Äù is your product?

#### DOD - characteristics
It‚Äôs about a Scrum Team agreement
Needs to improve over time: Teams should regularly review and update the DoD
Most important: no compromises on quality!

#### DoD Examples: 
Developer has unit tested the functionality
All acceptance criteria has been met
Regression have been completed
Code has been delivered by another developer 
Best practice: add the UATs within the Sprint

##### Definition of Done VS Acceptance Criteria
A feature is finite if:
- meets the generic criteria: definition of Done
- meets the specific criteria: Acceptance criteria

#### Definition of Done and Undone
Goal: Move the Undone in the Sprint! Usually by automating it
# Tracking progress & release planning
Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring progress is tracked and visible to everyone.
Dev are responsible by keeping their individual progress updated.

## Burn-down charts
Useful for the day by day check.

Y axis: number of points based on what PBIs are selected
X axis: day of the Sprint
Green line: ideal burndown line
Blue line: actual burndown




## Burn-up charts
To see how the team is progressing toward their overall project (or release) or work stream goal
Y axis: number of points the team need to complete to finish the release
X axis: Sprints
Green line: ideal burndown line
Blue line: scope line
White line: what the team is actually completing each sprint

# Scrum dysfunctions
Some typical Scrum implementation problems and think:
What is exactly the problem?
Why is this not good Scrum?
What could be the long term consequences?
How would you intervene as a ScrumMaster?

Problem list:
Work continues after Sprint‚Äôs end
What is exactly the problem?
Why is this not good Scrum?
What could be the long term consequences?
How would you intervene as a ScrumMaster?
The Team does not do a Sprint Review
During the Sprint Review the software is broken (and no actions taken)
Daily Scrum is too long and boring
Daily Scrum is not informative
Team members don‚Äôt go to the Daily Scrum
Sprint length changes every time
Sprint Backlog changed during the sprint
Product Backlog priorities change too often
Sprint Backlog priorities change very often
Stakeholders complaining during Sprint Review
Stakeholders not coming to Sprint Review
One or more team members have their ‚Äúown‚Äù stories
No Product Backlog Refinement done
Product Owner does not care about technical debt
In the retrospective the real team problems are not discussed

Agile adoption
Three Principles of adoption by LeSS 
‚Ä¢ Deep and Narrow Over Broad andShallow
‚Ä¢ Top Down and Bottom Up
‚Ä¢ Use Volunteering

Getting started
Educate everyone
Define ‚Äòproduct‚Äô
Define ‚Äòdone‚Äô
Have appropriately-structured teams
Only the Product Owner gives work to the teams
Keep project managers away from the teams

Culture follows Structure (or System) and viceversa (Spotify example). 
Job Safety: yes, Role Safety: no
Establish a clear direction
