Agile adoption
Three Principles of adoption by LeSS 
• Deep and Narrow Over Broad andShallow
• Top Down and Bottom Up
• Use Volunteering

Getting started
Educate everyone
Define ‘product’
Define ‘done’
Have appropriately-structured teams
Only the Product Owner gives work to the teams
Keep project managers away from the teams

Culture follows Structure (or System) and viceversa (Spotify example). 
Job Safety: yes, Role Safety: no
Establish a clear direction
