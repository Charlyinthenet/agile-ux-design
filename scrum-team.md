# The Scrum Team
3 main roles:
Product owner
Scrum Master
Development team members

## Development team
The goal is to have 3 to 9 people to contain the need for coordination and complexity as much as possible.
Focus: produce a potentially shippable product increment
Characteristics:
Self organized and operates with minimal input from external sources => self managing.
Task assignment
The development team owns the entire sprint backlog (selected product backlog items, plus developments tasks) = auto organizzati sul come trasformare un elemento del Product Backlog in un incremento di funzionalità potenzialmente rilasciabile
Accountable together
Responsible together for the best technical solutions
Multidisciplinary => Cross functional
Con al suo interno tutte le abilità necessarie per creare un incremento di prodotto
End2 End teams from the user to the product
100% committed

No hierarchy or sub-team.
There are no managers or team leads - it is a flat hierarchy
Doesn’t acknowledge roles/titles (they’re all team members) = non ci sono altri titoli, per un membro del Development Team, al di fuori di Developer…
the members of the Development Team may have specific skills and areas of focus, but the responsibility belongs to the entire Development Team as a whole
Event better: Feature Teams!

### Feature Teams VS Component teams
Feature teams shift the coordination challenge between teams away from upfront requirements, design, and inter-team project management and toward coordination at the code level. [...] with modern agile practices and tools, coordinating at the code level is relatively easy. - Larman, Vodde - “Scaling Lean and Agile Development”, pag. 174

#### Comunicazione
Component team: problem => communication in the team

In Alfie Kohn's book “Punished by reward” management by objectives (MBO) doesn't work - except in the short term.
Communication in the feature team can be solved with an informal group (a community of practice) made up of team representatives (everyone can participate but it is not mandatory) in which decisions are made - rather than carrying out work / tasks - and the results of these decisions flow into the backlog.
Open discussion means that a UX for example can participate in the architecture community.
It is the Scrum Master that stimulates the creation of communities and in case of discussion stimulates transparency by pushing to demonstrate, for example, pros and cons to submit them to the community.
#### Shared resources
How to maximize:
Early inclusion
Big picture perspective
Backlog understanding
Timing estimation
#### Norms
Helps members create shared behaviors to enhance performance.
Interaction norms:
All ideas are equal
Ask help suddenly
Keep commitments
Hold team accountable

Communications norms
Respect
gratitude

Meeting interaction norms
Device usage
Start / end on time
Preferred hours

Decision making norms
Consensus
Majority

Conflict resolution norms
Process
Expectation
Escalation

#### Tools and location
Co-location is the best but 
give team member the option (collaborative space VS individual space)
Digital file sharing
Chat and video conf tools


## Product Owner
He is a single person (not a committee)

### Product Owner as a Product Development Facilitator

The product Owner - like the backlog - of which he is the curator - is at the center.

In fact, stakeholders have a vague idea of ​​the product (their visibility follows). Only when this idea is well defined can the Development team create the product.
In order to do this, communication - clarification - is necessary, so that the Development team can write the Sprint Backlog.
It is the PO that:
Create the product strategy
Decide what should be in the backlog
Decide on prioritization

#### The “contract game”
It is from the mixture of the Business authority on Product Management and the responsibility of Development for everything related to R&D Management that the Contract Game for which the PO is responsible opens up.
From Larman-Vodde, “Practices for Scaling Lean & Agile Development”

### Product Owner - practical tips
#### Set the product vision
Design the box => https://gamestorming.com/design-the-box/

##### Turn the vision into a roadmap
4 hours for 4 day. Product roadmap session with Scrum master team and stakeholders
Choose story map (grouped in themes) and give priority note that this is an estimate that change at every session of planning.

##### Writing stories
Beginning: broad idea (epic) => then are decomposed in stories when more details appear.
With INVEST criteria.


To break down the epic 2 ways:
	⁃	CRUD functionalities
	⁃	steps 


##### Backlog grooming
Usually done in 2 meetings:
Pre-planning: with the all team so they eventually listen gap in a.cc
Backlog grooming: SM, PO, SME and technical expert they have to write stories and rewrite. Then the backlog is updated and the planning refined

##### Detailed release planning
1-2 hours  - Not the all project but 3 to 6 months
2 types:
schedule release plan: you have a due date and decide what to delivery by that time (by point and velocity)
functionality: determine what value to release in a time frame


##### Manage sprint failure
If that the stakeholder doesn’t agree with story or acceptance criteria. 
Abnormal termination of a sprint: the sprint is no valid (is the p.o. that has to decide)





## Scrum master 
The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that Scrum is understood: making sure the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum's values, practices and rules.
Focus attention on circumstances and main goals
Working with the team (everything - in order to balance the attention between the Dev team and the PO) trying to earn their trust.
The SM must be a medium not the controller. Hold a position of "multi-directed partiality" (https://behavenet.com/multidirectional-partiality - MS should act as the therapist)
SM is sometimes referred to as the servant leader. Key traits of a servant Leader:
Persuasion
Empathy
Listening & communicating
Tips: mirror what you heard
Negotiation

How the SM supports
Interaction team-team
Support the application of the scrum framework → Stay in the process 
Ensures goals, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone on the Scrum Team, 
Through Scrum practice (sometimes SM referred as a Team guardian)
Scrum Events
Daily standups → What’s getting in my way?
Scrum Artifacts
Help PO:
Understanding and practicing agility (chaching)
Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management;
Ensure that the Product Owner understands how to order Product Backlog items to maximize value;
Help the Scrum Team understand the elements of the Product Backlog clearly and concisely;
Understanding product planning in an empirical environment;
Ensure safety and ideas to evolve toward solutions
Is an environmental where curiosity, risk taking, challenging norms, Opinions are offered with respect
“Yes and” approach instead of “Yes but”
Ask “What else can we add to this idea?”
Replace
judgment with curiosity
Ask:
“Does this practice still apply to us?”
“What’s a radical idea?”
Promote share of idea and give equal weight, asking for example:
“Does the PO’s/Team’s voice get heard?”
“Are the PO’s priorities being expressed?”
“Are you doing a good job bringing those voice together?”

2.3.1 SMr at all stages
Forming (time when a team gets to know each other)
Forming tips
Anticipate the team’s questions
Repeat the purpose and vision


Team questions
Who are the other team members?
What is the work?
How should the work been tackled?
What are the process in getting work done?


Facilitate tips
Hold individual meeting
Facilitate group conversation



Storming (when disagreements arise on the team)
Storming tips
Focus on the team purpose and norms per risolvere i conflitti
Use facilitation and conflict resolution skills 
Storming in which the team does not perform per ecosystem in which management requires a lot of status reports, useless documentation, continuous emergencies, ... The SM tries to intervene to make management understand that agility also requires a change in the way management works ! Regardless of the reason, recovering agile development is usually relatively easy: given the level of collaboration within the team, it is very likely that the information is shared enough to make "recovery" actions much easier, as less dependent on the knowledge of individuals.
Tips
Keep goals in front of the team
Use Teams norms to guide interaction
Use measures of success


Norming (when members take responsibility for their work and team interaction)
Make sure the team’s doesn’t avoid controversy at this stage
Norming questions
What are current product defects and how can they be prevented?
How can the team become more efficient when delivering customers value?
What can the team deliver that will delight customers?


Performing (when the team is autonomous and operates with little guidance)
Member demonstrate loyalty. Conflicts are resolved quickly
